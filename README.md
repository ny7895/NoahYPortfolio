# NoahYPortfolio
This is my portfolio website
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. 
How is this site deployed?
It was deployed using Amazon S3 bucket that has static webhosting enabled. I have configured a codepipeline to integrate with GitHub so that whenever a push is made to main branch a CI/CD pipeline is ran so that my website is always up to date and running. 
Thanks for visiting!
